# AntiGrief_rplacetk
This is a fork of @auxiliatrix Antigrief bot, designed to work with rplace .tk

There are two versions of the script.
antigrief_rplacetk_RANDOM_1.0.js has random pixel placement

antigrief_rplacetk_SEQUENTIAL_1.0.js allows you to specify pixel placement.
For this, change lines 1 and 2 to the starting and ending coordinates.
Example:

let selection_protect_start = [496,439]
let selection_protect_end = [500, 447]

Have fun :)
